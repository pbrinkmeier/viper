## How to build

To convert the LaTeX file into a PDF including all the fancy graphics, get yourself a working TeXLive environment.

For the first build, which will need to convert the SVG and Graphviz files to PNG files, you will also need:

- Graphviz, more specifically the `dot` program (for converting Graphviz files into PNGs)
    - Arch Linux package: `graphviz`
    - For macOS, there is a Brew formula: `graphviz`
- ImageMagick, more specifically the `convert` program (for converting SVGs into PNGs)
    - Arch Linux package: `imagemagick`
    - For macOS, there is a Brew formula: `imagemagick`
